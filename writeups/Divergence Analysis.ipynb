    "\n",
    "For a longer discussion of this score, see https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/feature_selection.html#chi2\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the intuition: Given two text corpora, our null hypothesis is that a given term should appear with the\n",
    "same frequency in both corpora. e.g. we would expect the word \"the\" to make up about 1-2% of both corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dunning's Log-Likelihood test gives us a way to test how far a term deviates from this null hypothesis, i.e.\n",
    "how over or under-represented a term is in the female or male corpora (mathematically: how far the observed term counts\n",
    "deviate from the expected term counts). \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, terms will score high for G2 if a) they are frequent and b) they are heavily skewed towards one or another corpus. \n",
    "Ben Schmidt has a blog post which demonstrates how G2 captures a combination of additive difference (difference in absolute numbers) and\n",
    "multiplicative difference (difference between frequencies): http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2011/10/comparing-corpuses-by-word-use.html \n",
    "\n",
    "A Dunning value of 4 means p value < 0.05. A p value of 471911 as we find for \"Gender and Feminism\" means many many standard deviations away from expectation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency score is another measure that we can use to measure how gendered a topic is. It goes from \n",
    "0 (only men write about a topic) to 1 (only women write about a topic).<br>\n",
    "The math behind this score is simple:<br>\n",
    "`frequency score(topic) = weight of topic among women / (weight of topic among women + weight of \n",
    "topic among men)`<br>\n",
    "Here's an explanation that's more intuitive: Assume that we have an equal number of articles written\n",
    "by men and women (we don't but let's presume that's the case for the moment). In that case, a\n",
    "frequency score of 0.5 means that women contributed 50% of the weight to the topic and men the\n",
    "remaining 50%. A score of 0.89 (the score of \"Gender and Feminism\") means that women contributed\n",
    "90% of the weight and men 10%. <br>\n",
    "The reality is more complicated simply because we have about three times as many articles authored\n",
    "by men as articles authored by women (7506 to 2016). Hence, men did contribute about one third of \n",
    "the \"Gender and Feminism\" topic weight (37 to 79), simply because even when they are not gender\n",
    "historians, they will occasionally use \"Gender and Feminism\" terms like \"women,\" \"male,\" or \n",
    "\"female.\" <br>\n",
    "If we look at the average weights, however, we see that among women, \"Gender and \n",
    "Feminism\" has an average weight of 3.93% whereas among men, it has an average weight of 0.49%. This\n",
    "is the relationship that the frequency score expresses: 3.93% / (3.93% + 0.49%) = 0.89.\n",
